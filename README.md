# ntOS Documentation
/ This is the ntOS Documentation, for the discord bot and the roblox admin script.
/ The Roblox script is built upon Sceleratis´s Adonis project (https://adonis.dev)
/ I built the Discord bot myself though. It is closed source and uses Discord´s API. Go into it´s own folder to see the privacy policy. If you do not agree, block the bot or leave the server.
