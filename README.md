# ntOS Documentation
This is the ntOS Documentation, for the discord bot and the roblox admin script.
The Roblox script is built by Antrometik, and him only, you MAY NOT use his own, copyrighted code.
I built the Discord bot myself though. It is closed source and uses Discord´s API. Go into it´s own folder to see the privacy policy. If you do not agree, block the bot or leave the server.
